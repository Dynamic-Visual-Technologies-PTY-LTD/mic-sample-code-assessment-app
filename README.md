# Basic Calculator - File Operations Validation Tool

## Overview
This project is a simple **calculator** application designed primarily to **test and validate file operations** within a code assessment tool. While it provides standard arithmetic operations, its primary purpose is to serve as a reference implementation for testing **file handling, input validation, and structured coding practices**.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Functions**: Includes power calculation and square root operations.
- **File Operations**: Reads and writes calculation results to a file for assessment validation.
- **Error Handling**: Implements exception handling for invalid input and mathematical errors.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Uses `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` to manage dependencies.
- **Extensible Design**: Follows SOLID principles to ensure modularity and maintainability.
